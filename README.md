## PasswordChecker
#Dictionary Project- SummerII, London 2022 By Md Abubakkar
    
This is a program to check if passwords in a file are acceptable
for given criteria such as number of length or number of Uppercase
character allowed. To run this program simply type main.py and input all the
criteria/conditions. passwordInput.txt file has all the passwords to check and
Dictionery20K.txt has all the dictionary word that a password must avoid.
After running the program, and inputting all the conditions, 
passwordOutput.txt file will show what password was accepted and what was 
not (including the information what condition was violated). For any question
or comment please email me at abubakkar.howladar@gmail.com Thank you!!
